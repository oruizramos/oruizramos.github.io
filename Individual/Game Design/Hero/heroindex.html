        <h3 class="subtitulos">Description</h3> <br>
        <p><em>Hero</em> is a heavily story-driven, first person action-adventure game with a unique rhythm based combat. The game intends to evoke feelings of envy by creating a story where the actions of the player/main character will be confronted with contradictory beliefs presented by the game's setting and ultimately questioned about the the drive of their actions.</p> 
    </div> <br>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="column-1 box">
          <h3 class="subtitulos">Conceptualization</h3> 
           <br>
        
            The main four main pilars/milestones were set as the core structure for the game design: <br> <br> 
            
            -Make the hero likeable and easy to identify for the player <br> <br>
            -A thought-provoking story full of feelings and emotions that involved a personal situation of loss <br> <br>
            -Use a version of Lotman´s narrative model and narrative structures by EM Forster <br> <br>
            -Create an engaging combat system that feels challenging and interesting so it appeals to people who are looking for a good narrative game but don´t mind a challenging combat. </p>  
             <br> <br> <br>

          <h3 class="subtitulos">Flow of the game</h3> <br>
          <p>A usual run/playthrough from the player would be like this: <br>

            As soon as the player starts the game, the title screen will appear in the form of a TV screen. Once they press start, a cutscene where the cult leader gives a general message will be displayed. Afterwards, the camera will pan out to the left, giving the player the opportunity to see one of the masks besides the TV monitor (which has the intention to hint the player that it belongs to the main character). <br> <br>
            
            The main game will start at this point. The player will be put in the main central street that leads to a big tall building in the back. If the player walks straight ahead, they will meet the several different story events (getting a cat down from a street lamp, saving a man from being run over from a car, trying to save a woman from being beat up by his husband and stopping radical cultist from detonating a bomb) that leads to the combat matches. <br> <br>
            
            If the player decides to explore the side streets, they will find the propaganda posters and other events which will trigger cutscenes. Both offer more details about the backstory and will help the player better understand the setting of the game. <br> <br>
            
            Once the player reaches the main building, they will be confronted by the leader of the Destiny Cult(the main antagonist). The final cutscene will trigger, and the player will have to make a decision to experience one of the two different endings. </p> <br> <br>
            
            <h3 class="subtitulos">Gameplay/Combat</h3> <br>
            
            Originally, I intended the combat to be entirely rhythm-based. There was going to be a tempo bar at the bottom of the screen with colored segments. A key/button would appear on the screen, and the player would have to press it at the correct time, alongside clicking(with the mouse) on the corresponding colored-hand of the opponent. The better the player did(consecutive successful timed presses/clicks), the tempo would speed up to increase the difficulty. <br> <br>

            Ultimately, this proved to be quite challenging for some of the testers, so in the end, I adapted it by ditching the whole tempo gauge idea, and sticking only to timely pressing the correct key/button shown on the screen.

            <p>I was in charge of working on a couple of political propaganda posters for the game. The goal of these was to provide a more atmospheric experience and introduce more details of the overall setting/story of the game. The posters reflect the overall collective dystopian/brain-washed hivemind consciousness in which the inhabitants of the world live, and the tyranny they have been subjugated to, which they blindly accept. </p> <br> <br>
