        <h3 class="subtitulos">Description</h3> <br>
        <p> As part of my B.A thesis, I examined how level design in 8-bit Classic
            <em>Mega Man</em> -one of the most prolific and influential 2D platforming franchises of all
            time- developed and progressed over the course of some of its iterations. In order to
            collect data, a custom chosen set of principles and frameworks found in game and
            level design-related literature was put into use. The result was a comparative analysis
            with quantifiable information; which had the intention to further showcase both: how it
            progressively evolved from the lessons learned through the years, and how these
            combined elements in the levels, when put together in such manner, impacts the
            challenge provided to the player in meaningful ways. After the exaustive analysis was done, I decided to put the level design patterns/best practices observed in my findings into practice, and create a custom level, using the <a href="https://megamanmaker.com/" target="_blank">Mega Man Maker engine</a>. </p><br>

          <h3 class="subtitulos">Design overview</h3> 
           <br>
        
           <p>Since the well-known <em>Mega Man's</em> formulaic design philosophy of having all the initial stages open to the player's free will means every stage becomes potentially the first one; and therefore, every single one must at least try to ease the player into the game, I decided to study Dr. Wily's Stage 1(the first of the last four stages segment) of four different classic <em>Mega Man</em> games, as these are the only common type of stage, every game has, in addition to have an established predetermined order. Those would be ideal for analyzing patterns and consistent results on the thought process behind their creation and design as each new iteration was released. <br> <br>
            
           The end product was the creation of a custom Dr. WilyÂ´s Castle 1 level with the following characteristics/features, resultant of implementing an adapted version of the trends and patterns observed in my investigation.<br> <br> 

           -No more than 4 enemies at the same time on screen <br>
           -A balance between small, medium, and big enemies <br>
           -In order to adapt to new generations. Various checkpoints at key points (after a challenging section) <br>
           -Branching paths to increase replayability and variety. <br>
           -Multiple bosses at the same time <br> <br> <br>
