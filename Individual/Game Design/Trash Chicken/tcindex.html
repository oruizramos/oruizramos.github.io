        <p><em>Trash Chicken</em> is an endless/survival 2D top-down shooter with RPG elements. Rise up against the oppressive Foxes and reclaim your country for chicken-kind! You take the role of a mutated giant chicken and must free the cooped up chicks from their prisons and destroy the fox city and its inhabitants. Besides your large physique, your best weapons are the different weapons that are distributed across the city, to wreak ultimate havoc! But do not underestimate the power of the swarm, every chick you free will fight with you until your mob grows to an unstoppable horde!</p><br>

          <h3 class="subtitulos">Conceptualization</h3> 
           <br>
        
           <p>For this project, the theme of the proverbial principle of <em>"see no evil", "hear no evil" and "speak no evil"</em> represented by the three wise monkeys was given to work with. <br> <br>
        
            For me, the meaning of the three wise monkeys refers to the lack of moral responsibility to address something by ignoring it and walking away from it. Therefore, a traditional oppression/rebellion setting was a good way to implement the adage's interpretation. As a result, the core concept/ideology behind the game could be summarized as follows: <br> <br>

            For evil to win power, all ordinary beings have to do, is stand aside and: <br> 
            -Keep quiet <br> 
            -Turn a blind eye <br>
            -Turn a deaf ear <br>

            Since chickens are often well-known for their imitational behavior and ability to cooperate in big numbers, the idea of using them as a metaphor of how human collective efforts/psyche work, under tyranny or any other power-struggling situations, could be fitting with the theme. <br> <br>

            Additionally, chicken demonstrate: <br>
            -Flexible decision making, ability to break from routines to solve novel challenges. <br> 
            -Sophisticated coordination of group activities such as foraging, nesting, and group defense <br> 
            -Retention and application of past learning <br> 
            -Hens respond with empathy to chicks´ distress <br> <br>
            
            All these multiple characteristics started resonating as they had some sort of relevance and interesting metaphorical connections with the three wise monkeys´ proverb, and ultimately gave birth to what the actual game setting ended up being:  <br> <br>
            
            A society full of small oppressed chicks, coordinating a chaotic rebellion under the command of a big hen, in their last attempt to make a stand against their most common canine oppressors, the foxes! </p>

            <p><strong>Objectives and mechanics</strong> <br> <br>
            -Destroy buildings in order to get points. Each certain amount of points spawns a small chicken for your army. Additionally, you can destroy trapped chics in cages to join your army <br> 
            -There are 3 varieties of fox dens placed throughout the level which contain loot or items that upgrade your army <br> <br>

            -Small dens can be opened on the spot and add points <br>
            -Medium dens cannot be destroyed immediately and you must give up 5 of your small chickens to get the rewards <br>
            -Large dens cannot be destroyed immediately and you must give up 10 of your small chickens to get the rewards <br> <br>

            -The medium and Large nests contain upgrades/items for your army that take effect until the next wave. <br> <br>

            -Each wave will increase the difficulty of enemies and the number of them. Each certain amount of waves, an elite minion will spawn, which will have higher HP and a set of randomized abilities/attributes from a pool. <br> <br>

            -Each certain amount of waves, there will be a boss battle <br> <br>


            <strong>Losing conditions</strong> <br> <br>

            -If your character dies <br>
            -If you lose all your chicken in combat or to den-destroying duty <br> <br>

            <strong>Controls</strong> <br> <br>
            -Movement: WASD <br>
            -Left click: Shoot <br>
            -Right Click:: Dash <br>
            Note: While the game can be perfectly played with mouse+keyboard, since the theme of the project was being experimental, volume knobs were considered as an option as they could be easily implemented by replicating the functionality of dual sticks controls(left for movement, right for shooting)</p><br>
